Grade: 4.5/5

L2: Beware the double-file extension: .cpp.cpp. Should handle ANY number of rows, odd or even. Checks for odd #. 
Should prompt: Number of rows in diamond, not : an odd number. Nice use of ternary expression. (Could use 
ternary in cout statement for either space or *.) Gives warning on Line #47. rows can be int, not double.
